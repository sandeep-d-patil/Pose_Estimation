This blog aims to describe our efforts into reproducing the paper “Deep Directional Statistics: Pose Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification”. The paper discusses a method to perform tasks object pose estimation using uncertainty quantification. This uncertainty quantification allows for an increased robustness against images of varying quality.

The proposed method for uncertainty quantification consists of using a VGG-style convolutional network combined with a probabilistic von Mises distribution to predict the distribution over the object pose angle. The paper discusses three different types of von Mises distributions. First, where a single value determines the shape of the distribution. Second, where a finite number of mixture components determines the shape and third, where an infinite number of mixture components defines the shape. For this blog only the first variant will be elaborated. The data used for pose estimation are the PASCAL3D+, TownCentre and CAVIAR-o datasets. The CAVIAR-o and TownCentre datasets present a challenging task of coarse gaze estimation as the images are of low resolution, as they are obtained from surveillance camera videos. In the CAVIAR dataset, the images with occluded head instances are only considered for the dataset. Hence this paper aims to produce a Deep neural network focussed on head pose detection in crowded places from the surveillance cameras.
